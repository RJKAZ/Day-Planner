# Day-Planner
A day planner project.

This planner was created using a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Jquery, and Moment. It displays the time on the main page, and saves the inputed content to thhe browser. You can verify this by inspecting the page and going to the applications settings, which will show the inputed value in local storage. 

the time based color coding however I could not successfully implement.
